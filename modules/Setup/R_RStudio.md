## What are R and RStudio?
Throughout this course we will use the R program to generate graphs. We will interact with R through the RStudio software. From your perspective, you will be using RStudio, but you will actually be writing code in the R language. RStudio simply helps make R a little easier to use. The following links provide very brief introductions to R and RStudio.

As you now know, both R and RStudio are free to use. You can install them on your own computer or your can use RStudio in a webpage. Directions for both are below.

* Install R, RStudio, and associated package on your own computer -- [Windows](R_RStudio_Install_Win) or [Mac](R_RStudio_Install_Mac).[^Chromebook]
* Use RStudio in a webpage (i.e., [RStudio-in-the-Cloud](R_RStudio_Cloud)) and not have to install anything.

### Footnotes
[^Chromebook]: RStudio can be used on a ChromeBook but the setup is complicated. Some directions that may work for you are [here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/rstudio-desktop-on-a-chromebook-without-crouton-using-new-linux-beta-option/17393){:target="_blank"}, [here](https://github.com/jennybc/operation-chromebook#links-re-r-and-rstudio){:target="_blank"}, and [here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/rstudio-on-a-chromebook/2802){:target="_blank"}. I am not a Chromebook user and this looks endlessly confusing to me. It is possible, however, to use RStudio in “the cloud” through a web browser, which may be easier than installing on your ChromeBook -- [see here](R_RStudio_Cloud).
